==== Platform notes:

== msvc: Note that libraries must be built without SSL2 (that is to say, /arch:SSE) in order to link with msvc9 and msvc10. They should also be built with the Multi-threaded DLL runtime library.

==== Individual library notes:

== lua/win32: Use luavs.bat, but replace the main block with:

cd src
%MYCOMPILE% /arch:SSE l*.c
del lua.obj luac.obj
lib /nologo /out:lua51.lib l*.obj
del *.obj *.manifest
cd ..

== jpeg/win32: the built-in configuration enables Whole Program Optimization which not only restricts the output to a specific MSVC version, but a specific MSVC patch. As jpeg isn't performance-sensitive in Frames this has been disabled. If you want to rebuild the library you might be able to get some performance out of turning it back on.

== zlib/win32: Modify the makefile.msc to incldue /arch:SSE and /GS- then build.

== SDL/win32: SDL has a buggy chkstk implementation under win32. It is unclear why. Deleting its _chkstk definition is required to make it work properly. Also, at least under win32, it's set to build a .dll by default, and should be changed to a static library.
