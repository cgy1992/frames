==== Platform notes:

== msvc: Note that libraries must be built without SSL2 (that is to say, /arch:SSE) in order to link with msvc9 and msvc10. They should also be built with the Multi-threaded DLL runtime library.

==== Individual library notes:

== zlib/win

Remove all -Zi's from win32/Makefile.msc, add -arch:SSE -GS- in place

nmake -f win32/Makefile.msc (in each environment)

== libpng/win

projects/vstudio/vstudio.sln

Turn off debug output, set instruction set to SSE, add zlib includes

For 64-bit you will need to disable warnings-as-errors

== jpeg/win32

Delete !include <win32.mak> from makefile.vc - it seems to be broken

NMAKE /f makefile.vc setup-v10 (in any environment)

Remove garbage characters from the beginning of jpeg.vcxproj

Open jpeg.sln

Turn off debug output, set instruction set to SSE, disable Whole Program Optimization (it locks the library to a specific MSVC patch)

== lua/win

Use luavs.bat, but replace the main block with:

cd src
%MYCOMPILE% /arch:SSE l*.c
del lua.obj luac.obj
lib /nologo /out:lua51.lib l*.obj
del *.obj *.manifest
cd ..

== glew/win

build/vc10/glew.sln (open with vs10!)

turn off debug info, change to SSE, multi-threaded DLL

== freetype/win

builds/win32/vs2008/freetype.sln

multi-threaded DLL, SSE

Lib Release Multithreaded

== SDL/win

Find the definiton of _chkstk; delete it entirely, it appears to be buggy.

Change to build as a static library. Disable debug, instruction set SSE. Do this for both sdl and sdlmain.

== gtest/win

Will need to build this once for every compiler target.

No debug info; SSE build; multi-threaded DLL. You'll have to do this for both gtest and gtest_main.

Requires debug libraries as well thanks to debugiterator mismatches.

Requires _VARIADIC_MAX=10 on msvc11.
