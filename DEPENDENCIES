This is currently maintained by hand and isn't meant to track version numbers. It's just me making notes. Will be more official in the future.

Frames depends on:

* Boost
* Glew
* Libfreetype
* Libjpeg
* Libpng
* Zlib
* Lua or LuaJIT, your choice (LuaJIT recommended where available)

In future revisions many of these dependencies may be removed or made optional. Right now, it's deep in "just make it work" territory.
