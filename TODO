* Lua API
  * Rig up fundamentals
    X Structure
    X Createframe code
    X Insert frame to environment

  * Functions
    * Frame
    * Text
    * Texture
    X Mask
  * Events
    * Figure out how the API will work
  * Test re-update height if the width changes and wordwrap

* NaCl

* Lua API advanced
  * Optionally tag frames with filename, line number
  * Optional inline documentation
  * Handle Lua environment shutdown before Frames

* Crop to bounds in a way that won't look amazingly awful for barely-on-the-fringe lines
* Raw
* Flesh out frame events
  * Events that get passed down - the Bubble phase?
  * If any event does not return true, then stop, otherwise propogate the click upwards (does not occur for other events, just clicks)
* Figure out 9-slice
* Text entry
* Look over rift docs, verify that I have all the things

* Unit testing

* Derive font size adjustment more precisely - binsearch, or dig into the code and see wtf is going on

* Event queueing/buffering
* Subpixel text rendering
* Autocorpusing
* More text stuff
  * lazier text resolving, setting text then size shouldn't result in an extra
  * truncation marker
  * truncation marker whitespace return
  * glPixelStorei should be saved?
  * font color mappings
* Internal-prefix every internal function
  * Privatize more
* Convert layout engine to ints
* Build process for cygwin/linux/windows
* texture deallocation
  * split texture into its own thing
* async loading for textures someday
* figure out how to make config cleaner
* deal with allocation properly
  * remember image loading
  * thorough testing
* crunch down on header includes
* Multithreaded rendering
  * all sorts of queueing needed for things
* De-float everything
