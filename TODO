=== DOCS

* detailed usage of all frame types

* deal with removing the temporary documentation files better, even if they're open?

* Clear warnings
* Get Anchor and the like included

* Deep docs
  * need to put a thorough description of the pin API somewhere
    * add example "code" to pinning

* Final pass

=== DOCS TWEAK

* spellcheck
* The buttons on top don't behave properly
* class list->frames->*

=== TWEAK

* Rename projects
  core
  renderer_
  plugin_
  test_lib
  test_standalone

* Verify that appropriate files are all being included
* /Zl compiler option?
* script to build deps

=== DEPLOY

* Get licensing
* Send to small trusted group
* Post on some forum
* UE4 release

=== TESTING

* Circular parent set!

* Events
  * Modify events, re-call the same event recursively!

* Frames
  * Text is the big one here, especially everything involving editing

* Coverage

* Release?

=== BUILDING

* Simple examples
  * SDL/GL

* Figure out how to document Delegate

* Official release?

=== UE4

* Integrate with rendering subsystem
* Integrate with loading subsystem

* Start RHI renderer
  * UE-target only
    * Look into hud, postrender, etc
      * FD3D11DynamicRHI
      * RHIMethods

* Test suite
  * Base - may be difficult - thread sync?

* Start integration layer

* This means . . . an internal UE4-hook class, then the UE4 code itself hooks that?
* That seems ugly, but might be necessary
* Maybe some way to provide the right set of verbs to provide external APIs?
* That may be extremely difficult
  * Thoughts:
  * Obliterate is needed - last event fired before shutdown
    * fix up obliterate.cpp test case
    * will have to happen after events are finished processing

* Font corpus cleanup

* Figure out how to link in the precompiled shader
  * Remove d3dcompiler linkage

=== TWEAK

* Memory leak tracking
  * Max-frame-count value
  * Frame enumeration

* dxgidebug on vger

* get rid of split headers

* convert to https://code.google.com/p/jpeg-compressor/
* convert to that gl alternative

* Split Loaders into their own libs
  * Test

* opengl 3.2 core
* D3D11_USAGE_DYNAMIC fix

* Wire Environment->TextManager conversion
* Kill TextManager

* SRGB? that's a crazy idea, buuuut

* Linux?
* Clang?
* Clang Static?

* Redesign Lua API sanely

=== PROGRESSION

* Better global register setup

* DX support

* rejigger event core to handle remove-while-trigger better

* event for focus change?
* click outside to remove focus

* frames/textures don't appear until a window gets invalidated

* Scene - coordinate system transformations
* Stage - animations
* Canvas - freeform drawing, tiled textures
* Effect - Apply a simple effect to all members
* Postprocess - record what's underneath it, mutate it in some expensive fashion
* Bounds?
  * Or are we better off allowing some sort of delegate-style Width or Height? Freeform dependencies?

* someday, consider how to do Effect/Scene/Stage/Postprocess better
  * maybe some kind of runtime decorator system

* userdata

=== DOXYBUGS

* Enum?
* flatten class list so Frames::Input::Meta shows up as Input::Meta

* Includes friends in the .hhc
* public members of private subclass is included
* overloads look stupid
* get rid of class hierarchy

=== POLISH PASSES BELOW

* NaCl

* Raw
* Figure out 9-slice (much later?)

* Doublecheck Environment event spawners to make sure they're Obliterate-safe

* Call semantics:
  * Any Layout function can be called from an event handler at any time
  * Environment functions may not be called from event handlers
  * Doublecheck these in debug mode? Global event locks wouldn't be tricky

* Text distance field
  * http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tants/pba.html
  * http://directtovideo.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/gdc_2012_released.pdf
  * http://www.ronaldperry.org/PCTPres.pdf
  * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGZRHJvJYIg

* MouseHover?

* Unit testing

* Derive font size adjustment more precisely - binsearch, or dig into the code and see wtf is going on

* Lua API advanced
  * Optional inline documentation
  * At some point we should set up something to notify Frames if Lua shuts down first

* pageup/pagedown for textfields
* Refresh mouse position/mouseover when the layout changes
* Optimization:
  * Propogate acceptance bits upstream
  * Propogate full bounds upstream
* Event queueing/buffering to avoid reentrancy issues
* Subpixel text rendering
* Autocorpusing
* More text stuff
  * lazier text resolving, setting text then size shouldn't result in an extra
  * truncation marker
  * truncation marker whitespace return
  * glPixelStorei should be saved?
  * font color mappings
* Convert layout engine to ints
* Build process for cygwin/linux/windows
* texture deallocation
  * split texture into its own thing
* async loading for textures someday
* deal with allocation properly
  * remember image loading
  * thorough testing
* crunch down on header includes
* Multithreaded rendering
  * double buffering, triple buffering
  * all sorts of queueing needed for things
* De-float everything

* Test slugs
  * ogl2_1
  * ogl3_2_compat
  * ogl3_2_core
  * ogles2
  * ogles3
  * dx11_fl9
  * dx11_fl10
  * dx11_fl11
  * dx11_fl11_dbg
  * dx11_fl11_ref

=== JENKINS TWEAK

https://issues.jenkins-ci.org
* Don't leak file handles when unexpected shutdowns happen
* mspdbsrv.exe exclusion - feature request
* keep system awake when building?
