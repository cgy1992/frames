=== BUILDING

* Replace cmake with premake

* Deployment script
  * tag
    * Tag
    * Branch
      * test if appropriate
      * stable if appropriate
      * vX branch
      * vX.Y branch
  X generate
    X Build cmake project files
    * Clean for enduser usage (remove those wacky cmake projects)
  X build
    X Build libraries
  * deploy
    * Package

* Simple examples
  * SDL/GL
  * Win32/GL

* DLL support for remaining projects, fix up MSVC settings

=== PROGRESSION

* really need a global assert function
* Deal with notepad++ wanting to look inside my build directories
* Better global register setup
* improve C API

* DX support

* redesign event system to use global event IDs
* rejigger event core to handle remove-while-trigger better

* event for focus change?
* check text, see if we can toss out more of the englishified names
* click outside to remove focus

* frames/textures don't appear until a window gets invalidated

=== DOCUMENTATION NECESSITIES

* example runtime
* fix the debug hook provided for environment

=== POLISH PASSES BELOW

* guarantee order by some sort of global ID?
* Move GetParent more into Layout

* NaCl

* SetAlpha

* Raw
* Figure out 9-slice (much later?)

* Doublecheck Environment event spawners to make sure they're Obliterate-safe

* Call semantics:
  * Any Layout function can be called from an event handler at any time
  * Environment functions may not be called from event handlers
  * Doublecheck these in debug mode? Global event locks wouldn't be tricky

* Text distance field

* MouseHover?

* Unit testing

* Derive font size adjustment more precisely - binsearch, or dig into the code and see wtf is going on

* Lua API advanced
  * Optional inline documentation
  * At some point we should set up something to notify Frames if Lua shuts down first

* pageup/pagedown for textfields
* at some point we need to figure out mouseover testing and key fallthroughs
* maybe text really does need to insta-refresh its bounds? :/
  * not quite sure how that's going to work
* Refresh mouse position/mouseover when the layout changes
* Optimization:
  * Propogate acceptance bits upstream
  * Propogate full bounds upstream
* Make internal-only functions a little more obvious
* Event queueing/buffering to avoid reentrancy issues
* Subpixel text rendering
* Autocorpusing
* More text stuff
  * lazier text resolving, setting text then size shouldn't result in an extra
  * truncation marker
  * truncation marker whitespace return
  * glPixelStorei should be saved?
  * font color mappings
* Internal-prefix every internal function
  * Privatize more
* Convert layout engine to ints
* Build process for cygwin/linux/windows
* texture deallocation
  * split texture into its own thing
* async loading for textures someday
* figure out how to make config cleaner
* deal with allocation properly
  * remember image loading
  * thorough testing
* crunch down on header includes
* Multithreaded rendering
  * double buffering, triple buffering
  * all sorts of queueing needed for things
* De-float everything
