=== DOCS

* Deep docs

* Final pass

=== INTEGRATION

* Split OGL into its own lib
  * Test OGL

* Add DX11
  * Test DX11

* Split Loaders into their own libs
  * Test

=== TWEAK

* Linux?
* Clang?
* Clang Static?

* FindChild

* Redesign Lua API sanely

=== TESTING

* Obliterate
* Events

* Frames
  * Text is the big one here, especially everything involving editing

=== BUILDING

* need to figure out how buttons work; this is not complicated but it's being tricky

* Finish documenting Environment
* Tweak Input?

* Improve streaming API
* Improve configuration API
* Improve texture loading API
  * maybe this should all be done via modifiers after creation?
  * most of this really doesn't have to exist *at* creation

* Simple examples
  * SDL/GL

* Convert Environment to Create/Destroy functions
* Figure out how to document Delegate

* Official release?

=== UE4

* Need some way to build with the UE4 header tool
* However, also needs hooks in the frames for that to work
* This means . . . an internal UE4-hook class, then the UE4 code itself hooks that?
* That seems ugly, but might be necessary
* Maybe some way to provide the right set of verbs to provide external APIs?
* That may be extremely difficult
  * Thoughts:
  * Obliterate is needed - last event fired before shutdown

=== PROGRESSION

* really need a global assert function
* Better global register setup
* improve C++ API

* DX support

* redesign event system to use global event IDs
* rejigger event core to handle remove-while-trigger better

* event for focus change?
* check text, see if we can toss out more of the englishified names
* click outside to remove focus

* frames/textures don't appear until a window gets invalidated

* Scene
* Stage
* Canvas

=== DOXYBUGS

* Enum?
* flatten class list so Frames::Input::Meta shows up as Input::Meta

* Includes friends in the .hhc
* public members of private subclass is included
* overloads look stupid
* get rid of class hierarchy

=== POLISH PASSES BELOW

* guarantee order by some sort of global ID?
* Move GetParent more into Layout

* NaCl

* SetAlpha

* Raw
* Figure out 9-slice (much later?)

* Doublecheck Environment event spawners to make sure they're Obliterate-safe

* Call semantics:
  * Any Layout function can be called from an event handler at any time
  * Environment functions may not be called from event handlers
  * Doublecheck these in debug mode? Global event locks wouldn't be tricky

* Text distance field

* MouseHover?

* Unit testing

* Derive font size adjustment more precisely - binsearch, or dig into the code and see wtf is going on

* Lua API advanced
  * Optional inline documentation
  * At some point we should set up something to notify Frames if Lua shuts down first

* pageup/pagedown for textfields
* at some point we need to figure out mouseover testing and key fallthroughs
* maybe text really does need to insta-refresh its bounds? :/
  * not quite sure how that's going to work
* Refresh mouse position/mouseover when the layout changes
* Optimization:
  * Propogate acceptance bits upstream
  * Propogate full bounds upstream
* Make internal-only functions a little more obvious
* Event queueing/buffering to avoid reentrancy issues
* Subpixel text rendering
* Autocorpusing
* More text stuff
  * lazier text resolving, setting text then size shouldn't result in an extra
  * truncation marker
  * truncation marker whitespace return
  * glPixelStorei should be saved?
  * font color mappings
* Internal-prefix every internal function
  * Privatize more
* Convert layout engine to ints
* Build process for cygwin/linux/windows
* texture deallocation
  * split texture into its own thing
* async loading for textures someday
* figure out how to make config cleaner
* deal with allocation properly
  * remember image loading
  * thorough testing
* crunch down on header includes
* Multithreaded rendering
  * double buffering, triple buffering
  * all sorts of queueing needed for things
* De-float everything
