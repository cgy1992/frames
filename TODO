* Texmanager - need some way to explicitly create a backing, tie things to a given backing, etc
* Text
  * re-update if the width changes
  * font config stuff
    * default font
    * FontFromId?
    * TextureStreamFromId?
  * let's build the backend for Text, with the interface for TextManager
  * Stubbed out TM functions that do silly things
  * text manager
    * generate individual characters
    * texture manager - corpuses
    * layout engine, laying out
    * word wrap
  * truncation marker
  * truncation marker whitespace return
  
  * okay this is my current short-term TODO list
    X Create texture backing
    * Do text layout
    * Do glyph generation
    * Do extremely basic texture corpus generation
  * Kerning
  * lazier text resolving, setting text then size shouldn't result in an extra
  * glPixelStorei should be saved?
  * font color
  * font color mappings?
* Raw
* Flesh out frame events
  * Events that get passed down - the Bubble phase?
  * If any event does not return true, then stop, otherwise propogate the click upwards (does not occur for other events, just clicks)
* Figure out 9-slice

* Internal-prefix every internal function
  * Privatize more
* Convert layout engine to ints
* Build process for cygwin/linux/windows
* texture deallocation
  * split texture into its own thing
* async loading for textures someday
* figure out how to make config cleaner
* deal with allocation properly
  * remember image loading
* crunch down on header includes
* Multithreaded rendering
  * all sorts of queueing needed for things
